##  A recommender system using Association Rule Mining

#### Customers nowadays make online purchases. When a customer buys an item, what are the related or complementary items that can be presented to them to promote cross-selling?

Association Rule Mining is an unsupervised machine learning technique, also known as Market Basket Analysis. It is used to find frequent itemsets. A frequent itemset is a set of items that frequently appear together and satisfies both the minimum support threshold and minimum confidence threshold.
Association rules are then generated from the frequent itemsets.

In the context of business applications, association rules can be
- utilized to make recommendations for complementary or frequently co-purchased items.
- used to create targeted marketing messages and offers that emphasize the relationships between items.
